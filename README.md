Backend engineer by trade. **AI Champion 🦾 and Occasional Doctor 🩺** — I’ll patch Copilot up just so I can break it again two minutes later.

## Method to the Madness 🌀

> “…There was madness in any direction… A fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right… Our energy would simply prevail… We had all the momentum… We were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave… And in a very real sense, **the tendency is to push it as far as you can.**
>
> — Hunter S. Thompson

The people who push boundaries, set examples, break systems and rebuild them better — _those_ are the ones who make a real difference. _That’s_ the lane I choose to live in.

Not just to be "good", but to make everyone around me an expert in the process. And if that means I have to break it a million times before I figure it out, then so be it. There’s a method to my madness — and in the chaos, there’s always something beautiful waiting to emerge. 🌪️🦄

## 💼 Chaos @ Work

Senior Software Developer @ **The Home Depot**.
I sit happily at “the second seat” — someone else shoulders the heavy work and nonstop meetings (well… more than mine anyway) while I get to make the fun calls:

- Starting **conventional commits** ✅
- Wiring repos with **linters that break builds** ✅
- Updating Slack workflows so PRs without CODEOWNERS get auto-rejected ✅
  - 🤫 that's a surprise. But in my defense, I _did_ say it was going to happen about 10 times already.

> It’s not about being mean (well… not _just_ that, but after ~10 years in the industry, we deserve _a little_ 🤏 leeway for scaring best practices out of people. In all the best ways, of course!) — it’s about **excellence**.

Do I honestly care if you put commas at the end of every single line in Node files? Nope. Sprinkle them in like confetti if it makes you happy. 🎉
What I _don’t_ want is a pull request diff filled with meaningless noise because somebody stripped them out — only for the next person to add them back in with no rhyme or reason besides “that’s how I like it.”

**AI tracking every commit. No more format wars. No more diff fights. Linters to the rescue.** 🌪️🔥

## ⚡ Projects in the Wild

These are the projects that escaped work — half-banned experiments, dev rants turned into code, and the occasional side quest that somehow worked:

- **[CheckMarK](https://github.com/yourusername/checkmark)** ⚡ – hack-time junk drawer: Copilot mischief, repo workflows, anything and everything else that didn’t fit elsewhere.
- **[NPM JS Template (aka Lint Lockdown)](https://www.github.com/anchildress1/npm-nodejs-template)** – the “friendly” tool that makes sure you _can’t_ escape conventional commits or proper formatting.
- **[Awesome GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/anchildress1/awesome-github-copilot)** – custom instructions, prompts and chat modes for GitHub Copilot, each with its own personality.

> If it didn’t make it through the front door 🚪 at work, it probably landed here.

## ✍️ Chaos in Writing

I blog weekly on **[DevTO](https://dev.to/anchildress1)** ☕ — equal parts chaos, caffeine, and _“didn’t think that through, but it worked anyway.”_

New posts are mostly about GitHub Copilot, but the topic roulette wheel spins randomly every week.

> 🦄 I know this complains because everything that would count as a contribution is locked away in a different user. I'm going to work on that, but in the meantime it's not a terrible score, considering the zereos. Although, I am not happy it gave me a junior score. Gonna fix that, too! 🤪
